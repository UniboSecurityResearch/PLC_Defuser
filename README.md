# PLC-Defuser
This repository contains the code and the dataset for the paper "PLC-Defuser: Detecting Hidden Ladder Logic Bombs in PLCs via Control Flow Graph and Model Checking".

### Datasets

Currently, we developed three datasets of PLC logic controlling the following physical processes:

* [Tennessee Eastman Process](https://github.com/Fortiphyd/GRFICSv2) (`GRFICS`)
* [Secure Water Treatment Plant](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/testbeds/secure-water-treatment-swat/) (`SWAT`)
* [Water Tank](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10639995) (`Water_tank`)
